# SoloDev Documentation

SoloDev is an AI-powered learning platform designed to help users explore and master software development topics in a simple, efficient, and structured way. It integrates curated YouTube tutorials, Google search results, AI-generated summaries, and practice questions into a seamless learning experience.

---

## Features

- Search any topic and receive:
  - A relevant YouTube tutorial
  - Top Google search results (official docs, articles)
  - AI-generated summary (copyable and editable)
  - Practice questions for retention
- Fast and secure authentication with Clerk
- Server-side caching for fast API response
- Clean light-mode UI optimized for learning

---

## How It Works

### 1. Authentication

- Users sign in via Clerk.
- Only authenticated users can access `/search` and `/topic/[topic]`.

### 2. Search Flow

- Users visit `/search`.
- After submitting a search, they are redirected to `/topic/[topic]`.
- The topic parameter is used to fetch content from external APIs.

### 3. API Integration & Server-Side Fetching

- APIs used: YouTube, Google Custom Search, OpenAI.
- All requests are routed through `/api/topic?query=...`.
- Core server utilities:
  - `fetchGoogleResults.ts`
  - `fetchYoutubeVideo.ts`
  - `generateAiContent.ts`

### 4. Caching

- Server response headers:  
  `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=59`
- Client-side fetch:  
  `fetch(..., { next: { revalidate: 300 } });`
- Cache Time-to-Live (TTL): 5 minutes.

### 5. Protected Routes

- Clerk middleware protects the following routes:
  - `/search`
  - `/topic/[topic]`

## User Experience & Pedagogical Design

- **Video**: visual reinforcement
- **Text links**: access to in-depth resources
- **Notes**: users can copy AI summaries or write their own
- **Practice**: improve retention with quizzes

Users are encouraged to copy or export summaries using the copy button.
